# Kanban Board
A simple Kanban board application where users create, update, and delete tasks and boards. Tasks and boards both ahve drag and drop functionality.
User signup and login is required to use the application.
# Application motivations and shortcomings
This project was made as an exercise to learn Angular with some simple backend Firebase database and hosting.
As this is an Angular focused application, most of the styling is handling by Angular material and some of the extra features like drag and drop are handled by Angular CDK.
While this app will work on mobile, the kanban board layout is made first with desktop users in mind and there is some vertical scrolling on small screens.
