# KanbanBoard
This project was made as an exercise to learn Angular with some simple backend Firebase database and hosting.
Users of this project can create, update, and delete Kanban boards as well as tasks on those boards.
To access the boards, users will also need to create an account using an email/password or google signin.

As this is an Angular focused application, most of the styling is handling by Angular material and some of the extra features like drag and drop are handled by Angular CDK.
While this app will work on mobile, the kanban board layout is made first with desktop users in mind and there is some vertical scrolling on small screens.

The full application can be accessed here: ()
